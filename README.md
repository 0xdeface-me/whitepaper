# 0xdeface.me Whitepaper

> A standard to settle Ethereum smart contracts fairly in case of
> vulnerabilities.

## Abstract

An estimated 3 million ETH (350 million USD) are locked in vulnerable smart
contracts today. Fortunately, only 0.30% (9,094 ETH, or approximately 1 million
USD) has been claimed by attackers, but smart contracts continue to be attacked
on a daily basis [1]. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to incentivize
the responsible disclosure of smart contract vulnerabilities. We introduce a
game (0xdeface.me) that incentivize a) security researchers to disclose
vulnerabilities to contract operators instead of draining their funds; and
b) contract operators to release a reward when a security breach is found and
safely destroy contracts by returning funds to the stakeholders. We think this
will transform smart contract security by changing the model from a
negative-sum game to a positive-sum game. The goal of 0xdeface is to make
Ethereum more secure by mitigating the impact of smart contract vulnerabilities,
hence increasing the adoption and implementation of smart contracts to manage
funds in a decentralized fashion.

## Introduction

Smart contracts represent a paradigm shift in programming, enabling the
permissionless and transparent transfer of monetary value. This has only been
practically possible since the launch of Ethereum. Since smart contracts are
still so new, we are still developing best practices, and well-established
best practices will take years to stabilize.

In Ethereum, smart contracts are written in Solidity or Vyper, both
inspired by existing programming languages: Javascript and Python, respectively.
In both cases, the base language was slightly adjusted to provide new primitives
to allow the transfer of monetary value possible. This approach has been
criticized, however, especially in the case of Solidity, which has faced
claims that its design principles were too relaxed for the secure transfer of
money. And indeed, Solidity does feature odd design choices: (1) it doesn't
have under- and overflow protection, (2) interfaces are not enforced, (3)
similar modifiers are easily confused as their naming is virtually
indistinguishable, (4) code reuse is implemented through multiple inheritance,
a complex pattern that can lead to non-trivial bugs [13], and (5) inline
assembly is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to audit.

No one has been surprised that the combination of these design choices, a lack
of best practices, and inexperienced developers has resulted in several million
ETH being stolen. The most notable incident was in June 2016, when an attacker
drained 3.6 million ETH from TheDAO [2], forcing the Ethereum community to hard
fork the network to allow TheDAO users to withdraw their funds. Although the
situation has improved greatly over the past few years, with (1) the community
working together to develop best practices, (2) developers gaining experience,
and (3) professional audit firms reducing risks pre-launch, writing secure
smart contracts is still a challenge.  To this day, even the most experienced
teams [12] and their world-class auditors make mistakes [3] and will continue
to make mistakes going forward.

To further understanding of this phenomenon and to give proper context, we'd
like to highlight the incentives at play. Specifically, we'd like to elaborate
on the motivations to attack contracts and how we think 0xdeface.me can
improve the situation by shifting from an ecosystem-wide negative-sum game to a
positive-sum game.

## Motivation

Each smart contract that stores ETH is essentially a bounty on itself,
offering a tempting target for attackers. We expect to see the frequency and
ingenuity of attacks on smart contracts increase in the future, as the number
of smart contracts grows, the amount of money at stake increases, known
vulnerabilities are better documented, and automated auditing
suites like Consensys' Mithril [4] and TrailOfBits's ManiCore [5] make finding
vulnerabilities easier.

In this section, we discuss why it is (1) seemingly rational for an attacker to
target smart contracts, (2) difficult to maintain smart contracts and (3) that
this situation leads to a negative-sum game. We conclude that there should be an
ERC standard and marketplace for the consensual exchange of vulnerabilities
between attackers and contract operators.

To begin, let's discuss why it is seemingly rational for an attacker to target
smart contracts.

Since the dawn of Bitcoin and Ethereum, there has been a commonly shared
conviction within the community that transparency, decentralization, and
permissionless innovation is key to the success of the respective ecosystems.
For several reasons, developing a smart contract as closed source is considered
a faux-pas: (1) Users should be able comprehend the full functionality of a
smart contract (transparency); (2) Nobody must be able to exercise full control
over a contract (decentralization); (3) Everybody must be allowed, to
innovate on any part of the infrastructure, without cost (permissionless).
For these reasons, it is a widely accepted best practice that smart contracts
must be open source. We recognize that *security through obscurity* is
not a viable defence mechanism, but it must be acknowledged that for a smart
contract attacker, open source smart contracts lowers the barrier to entry and
lets them see what they are attacking.

Over several weeks, 0xdeface used an Ethereum full node to crawl the Ethereum
blockchain and GitHub to discover newly uploaded smart contracts. By leaving
their `/build` folder in their GitHub repository, contract repositories could
be found easily by querying for their address using the GitHub search API.
While the setup of this experiment was trivial, it yielded many vulnerable
smart contracts as potential targets. In many cases, Mythril even pointed
toward specific functions and vulnerabilities to exploit [9]. An even simpler
means to search for vulnerabilities is to occasionally review Etherscan's
"Verified Contracts" page [5] for smart contract  source code [footnote 1]. The
lesson here is that while open source contracts might lead to greater security
across the ecosystem as a whole, it does not necessarily lead to greater
security for individual contracts.

Once an attacker has access to a contract's source code, they can set up a local
environment using tools like Ganache, Truffle and Remix IDE. This local setup
is then used to simulate attacks against the contract. If a critical
vulnerability is found, the attacker can, given the deterministic nature of
Ethereum, confidentially assess whether the vulnerability can be used to drain
funds from the main net contract. Using privacy-preserving technologies like
TOR, Monero, and Zcash, this makes attacks efficient, cheap, largely anonymous,
and therefore rational for an attacker.

Now that we've given reasons that attacking smart contracts is rational,
we'd like to elaborate on why it is difficult for operators to maintain their
contracts once deployed.

The reason is simple: Smart contracts are immutable. Every contract uploaded to
the Ethereum network is assigned an address generated using the deployer's
address and a nonce. This address is then used by clients to interact with the
contract. Today, Ethereum smart contracts cannot be changed in place
[footnote 2]. The options for the contract operator are limited to the
following maintenance schemes: (1) Build an upgradeable contract using
proxy-patterns or (2) Deploy a revised version of the contract and inform
users of the change.

Unfortunately, both options come with significant negatives:
(1) An upgradeable proxy contract is inherently not permissionless or
decentralized. Though implementation-specific, it likely defines an operator
that is able to change the proxy routing such that potentially users' funds
could get, in the worst case, stolen.
(2) Informing users and updating apps to the newly generated contract address
is cumbersome, trust-maximizing and non-scalable. It comes with increased
scrutiny by the community, potential loss of credibility and significant cost.

For traditional software, a patch for a vulnerability can be distributed by
releasing a new version of the product (that might trigger other auto-update
patterns) or, in case of a web application, the fix can be put in production
within minutes. Ethereum's immutability makes fixing vulnerabilities
non-trivial. For many businesses in the ecosystem, smart contract
vulnerabilities might in fact be a worst-case scenario. Maintaining deployed
contracts is, and will continue to be, difficult.

This brings us to why attacking smart contracts is currently a negative-sum
game. First, we argue why attackers may not be incentivized to attack
contracts. Second, we highlight the problems of contract operators suffering an
attack. Third, we state the role of the user in the situation.

Attacking contracts, especially ones of well-known projects, often comes with
several negatives for the attacker:
(1) Increased attention by social media and community vigilance can lead to the
attacker being identified and exposed.  
(2) By crowd-sourcing the attacker's addresses, stolen funds can be traced and
effectively frozen by exchanges. The stolen ETH is taken out of the circulating
supply, making attacks a negative-sum game.
(3) Stolen funds can most likely not be exchanged into fiat, as most exchanges
require KYC for larger amounts.
(4) An attacker runs the risk criminal prosecution, as stealing users'
funds is very likely an offense in many jurisdictions [footnote 3].

We believe these factors are a big part of why such a small portion of
vulnerable funds—only 0.3%—have been claimed by attackers [1].

For a contract operator, the situation is equally tricky.
(1) Bounty programs are often run before a contract is deployed. After
deployment, the contract quite literally _becomes_ the bounty [8].
(2) As seen recently, audits can only limit the risk of vulnerabilities but
not totally eradicate them [footnote 4].
(3) Successful attacks to deployed contracts are often businesses' worst-case
scenarios, resulting in the entire project shutting down (see: TheDAO) [2].

Contract users are probably the worst off of all parties. They potentially lose
all their funds and often have no way to participate in governance
decisions taken by a contract operator under fire. Regulation lags well behind
the technology. This results in a lack of accountability. Who's to blame for
the loss of user funds? The attacker? The contract operator?
The user themselves?

Since stolen ETH is essentially taken out of circulation, we conclude that
smart contract security is  a negative-sum game. That's where 0xdeface comes in.
0xdeface (ERC-XXXX) is a standard to settle vulnerable smart contracts fairly
in favor of users and developers.
Auditors confidentially submit disclosures to 0xdeface. Contract operators
review disclosures. If the auditor and contract operator agree a critical
vulnerability has been found, then a contract can be settled fairly by returning
its users' funds. Auditors get rewarded with a bounty held in escrow by
0xdeface's Negotiator.

## Overview

0xdeface's incentive game consists of multiple components. In this section we
define the components and how they form an incentive game.

### Negotiator

The _Negotiator_ is 0xdeface's central component. It is an Ethereum smart
contract consisting of functions for:
(1) an attacker to _commit_ a vulnerability,
(2) a contract operator to _pay_ for a vulnerability,
(3) an attacker to _reveal_ a vulnerability and
(4) a contract operator to _decide_ on a vulnerability.
In essence, the Negotiator allows an attacker to confidentially transmit a
vulnerability to a contract operator using public-key cryptography
(commit and reveal). For a contract operator to view a vulnerability,
however, they must send a stake to the Negotiator (pay). If a potential
vulnerability has been found, the contract operator must decide to either
(decide):

1. Shut down the contract, return its users' funds, and send the stake to the
   attacker; or
1. Ignore the vulnerability, sending the stake back to the contract operator.

In the following sections, we argue that the Negotiator incentivizes the
fair settlements of contracts.

#### Proof of Attacking

In the 0xdeface protocol, an attacker is able to submit a hash of their
unencrypted vulnerability report along with their `commit`. While this doesn't
expose the report, it allows the attacker to prove publicly that they submitted
a legit vulnerability at a certain point in time (time-stamping). If the
contract operator shuts down the contract using a non-compliant procedure, then
the attacker can reveal the content of the time-stamped report and prove to the
world that the operator didn't play the game fairly. We call this scheme Proof
of Attacking.

### Exploitable ERC standard

Another central component is 0xdeface's _Exploitable_ ERC standard. It is an
optional interface for developers to implement, potentially preventing their
contracts from getting drained. Exploitable currently consists of seven
functions:

1. `ExploitableVersion()`: Return the version of the incentive game
1. `implementsExploitable()`: Check the contract's compatibility
1. `ExploitableReward()`: Return the attacker's potential reward in Wei
1. `pay(uint256 vulnId, string publicKey)`: For the operator to submit their
   public encryption key along with the attacker's reward
1. `decide(uint256 vulnId, bool decision)`: For the operator to decide on the
   severity of a vulnerability
1. `restore()`: Invoked when an operator decides to ignore a vulnerability; and
1. `exit()`: Invoked when an operator decides to shut down the contract due to a
   vulnerability.

In the following sections, we discuss how developers will profit from
implementing the Exploitable ERC standard.

### 0xdeface.me Website

0xdeface.me serves as a hub for all stakeholders (operators, attackers
and contract users). We believe there is a large untapped potential for
improving the security of Ethereum smart contracts by gamifying the experience.
0xdeface.me allows contract operators to confidentially negotiate with attackers,
attackers to be rewarded fairly and users to be able to participate in
governance decisions. By building this infrastructure, 0xdeface aims to nurture
a community of security professionals by providing tools for collaboration and
automation.

Now that we highlighted the main components, we will walk through the process of
committing and eventually exiting a vulnerability.

## Process

This section outlines the interactive process of _commiting_, _paying_,
_revealing_ and _deciding_ on a vulnerability. As it serves the purpose to
further understand *how* the system works, we're going to ignore incentives for
now. Instead we're going to make a few assumptions to keep it simple: (1) The
Exploitable contract implements the Exploitable ERC standard.  (2) The attacker
is willing to participate in 0xdeface's incentive game.  Additionally, we're
only going to describe one happy path here. We'll discuss incentives and attack
vectors in one of the following sections.

As figure 1 illustrates, the process starts with the attacker finding a
vulnerability in the Exploitable contract.

![figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xdefaceme/whitepaper/master/assets/figure1.png)

The attacker calls `commit(IExploitable Exploitable, uint256 damage)` on
the Negotiator contract. `Exploitable` is the vulnerable contract and
`damage` is the potential damage the vulnerability could cause (in "Wei").
Note that in this first iteration, we allow the attacker to set
the estimate themselves [footnote 5].

Calling `commit`, the Negotiator contract will make sure that `IExploitable
Exploitable` implements `implementsExploitable()` and that `damage` doesn't
exceed the Exploitable's balance. If this is the case, a new vulnerability
will be added and a `Commit(uint256 id, address Exploitable, uint256 damage,
address attacker)` event will be emitted to inform the contract operator [footnote
6].

At this point no information about the vulnerability has been put
online yet. The vulnerability report will be encrypted using eth-ecies
(public-key cryptography), so the contract operator must first share a public
key with the attacker [10]. This is done by the contract operator calling
`pay(uint256 vulnId, string publicKey) public payable`. `pay` checks
(1) if the vulnerability exists, (2) if an appropriate bounty was sent, and
(3) if the sender is the Exploitable contract. Is this the case, then the
vulnerability is marked paid, the public key is stored and a `Pay(uint256 id,
address Exploitable, uint256 bounty)` event is emitted to inform the attacker.

As the contract operator's public key is now available to the attacker, the
vulnerability can be encrypted using a public key encryption scheme.
The attacker then uploads the report to IPFS and shares the hash by
calling `reveal(uint256 vulnId, string hash)`. If (1) the vulnerability exists,
(2) the attacker has sent the vulnerability from the account that committed it,
and (3) the vulnerability was previously paid for, the hash is revealed to the
contract operator through an event `Reveal(uint256 id, string hash)`.

Using the revealed hash, the contract operator can now download the report from
IPFS, decrypt it using their private key, and study it. They now have two
options:
(1) Decide to ignore the vulnerability and therefore send the bounty back to
themselves; or
(2) Decide to give away under the vulnerability and shut down their contract.
If they decide to give in, then the Negotiator sends the bounty to the
attacker's account.
Either way, the Negotiator emits a `Decide(uint256 vulnId, bool decision)` event
and closes the vulnerability.

In this section, we discussed a possible "happy path" to disclosing a
vulnerability. Of course, there are many other branches. To highlight
these, we discuss the incentives at play in the next section.

## Incentives

Earlier in this paper, we claimed that 0xdeface transforms attacking
smart contracts from a negative-sum game to a positive-sum game. As there are
many human factors involved in the decision to maliciously drain a contract's
funds, it would not make sense to outline a mathematical model of the problem
here. Instead, this section argues that attackers and contract operators should
use the 0xdeface protocol, and shows why this transforms attacking contracts
into a positive-sum game. We make the case for why contract operators should
implement the Exploitable ERC standard.

By implementing the Exploitable ERC standard, contract operators have the
option to dynamically set bounties on a main net contract. While there is
a cost involved in offering a bounty to attackers, it comes with
several benefits:
(1) It can be grown dynamically with the size of the contract's balance;
(2) The contract operator's business may have changed or grown so that the
vulnerability may not be the worst-case scenario for the contract operator's
business anymore;
(3) Shutting down and redeploying contracts becomes a canonical process;
(4) Vulnerabilities are disclosed directly to the contract operator and do not
end up on secondary markets instead; and
(5) Investors and community are reassured that their funds are insured. In case
of a shutdown, they'll likely not become angry or hesitant to invest.

Attacking smart contracts becomes a legitimate occupation, since with the
Exploitable ERC standard, attackers don't have to:
(1) Engage in criminal activities [footnote 7];
(2) Worry about public exposure, as they're not stealing money from investors.
Rather, the protocol allows for a "Proof of Attacking", which lets attackers
gain credibility and become heroes to the community rather than villains.
We believe this will foster an agile hacker community, complete with quickly
evolving best practices; and
(3) Risk having their stolen funds blacklisted. Since bounties will be acquired
legally, they can be converted to fiat and used at the receipient's discretion.
We expect the most successful attackers could live on the proceeds of their
legitimate security work.

Finally, users' funds are secured through the 0xdeface protocol. Since attackers
will be more inclined to collect the bounty than drain the contract, user
funds will not be affected by the disclosure of vulnerabilities. In addition,
the Exploitable ERC standard is generic enough to allow users to vote on how to
handle a vulnerability, e.g. via Aragon Agent [11]. This could make users part
of the governance process in case of a imminent settlement.

The 0xdeface protocol can provide utility to users, attackers, and contract
operators, and we believe this increased utility is of greater value than the
increased cost of paying bounties to attackers. For this reason, the 0xdeface
protocol could make contract attacking a positive-sum game.

In the next section, we'll elaborate on the potential attack vectors of the
protocol and how we plan to mitigate them.

## Attack Vectors and Limitations

This section will list all known attack vectors and limitations of the protocol
and explain how we plan to mitigate them. As more attack vectors or limitations
become known, we'll update this list.

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. What if an attacker doesn't want to participate in the 0xdeface protocol?

We believe we've made a compelling case for why an attacker should participate
in the 0xdeface protocol. If an attacker wants to drain a contract implementing
the Exploitable ERC standard anyways, they can do so. The 0xdeface protocol
doesn't have a mechanism to prevent irrational actors from doing damage, but
it makes it less likely that rational actors will do so.

We believe that experimentation will be necessary to find the right parameters
for the 0xdeface protocol. At this point we can only speculate about the optimal
ratio between a contract's balance and the 0xdeface protocol bounty. We are
committed to experimenting with these parameters before launching to give
contract operators reliable heuristics.

#### 2. What if an attacker submits a vulnerability but never reveals it?

All vulnerability structs have a timeout property. If a contract operator pays
for a submitted vulnerability but the attacker never  calls `reveal()`, a
timeout expires that allows the contract operator to reclaim the paid bounty.

#### 3. What if a contract operator decides to ignore a legitimate vulnerability?

A contract operator can choose to ignore a vulnerability. However, in this
situation they still risk their contract being drained by an attacker.

#### 4. What if a contract operator is able to adjust the value of `ExploitableReward` mid-process?

The Exploitable ERC standard is not opinionated about the implementation of
`exploitReward`. A contract operator could implement an adjustable
`exploitReward` function that, when `pay` is called, could yield a smaller than
expected bounty. Attackers should always audit the Exploitable ERC
standard functions carefully to make sure they're not tricked into giving away a
vulnerability for free.

#### 5. What if an attacker maliciously sets the damage estimate to a higher than legit value?

The contract operator is responsible for making sure the attacker has correctly
estimated the `damage`. As the `damage` will ultimately dictate
the bounty payout the attacker receives, the attacker might be tempted to set
the `damage` estimate to a higher value. If this is the case, we recommend the
contract operator to decline the vulnerability and to explain why:
`string reason = "Damage value too high/low"`. This will allow the attacker to
submit the vulnerability again but with a correct `damage` estimate.

#### 6. What if a legit vulnerability is committed but the contract operator chooses to audit the contract code themselves instead of paying the bounty?

A contract operator can choose not to `pay` for a submitted vulnerability,
and instead audit the code themselves. If they have enough time, they can find
the vulnerability and shut down the contract in a controlled manner.

However, we do not believe this approach is in the best interest of contract
operators:
(1) The contract operator risks the attacker losing patience and choosing to
drain the contract illegally;
(2) To execute a controlled shutdown, the operator would have to a implement a
non-compliant shutdown procedure before deploying the contract. Attackers
could easily spot this, and if they were suspicious they might be less likely to
commit a vulnerability in the first place. The contract operator increases
their risk of their contract being drained illegally if it looks like they
aren't playing the game fairly;
(3) If a contract operator implements a non-compliant shutdown procedure and
an attacker submits a vulnerability anyway, then chooses to shut down the
contract, this will attract the attention of users and other attackers. They'd
be able to see that the contract operator is not playing the game fairly. We
believe that in this case, the contract operator's reputation in the community
would suffer significantly. Attackers may not work with them in the future, and
the community may see them as being unreliable and selfish. Future attackers
would be more likely to simply drain their future contracts illegally.

Even though we believe the arguments above are sufficient to stop this
behavior from happening, there are other things the protocol can help the
attackers with:
(1) The attacker can reveal their Proof of Attacking, showing to the community
that a contract operator didn't play the game fairly. We believe this would
trigger a community backlash against the contract operator in favor of the
attacker, as the community understands that good faith security research should
be fairly compensated.
(2) The attacker could choose to announce the release of the time-stamped and
unencrypted report publicly after a set time. While there may be concerns about
blackmail over forced bounty payments, this risk could pressure contract
operators into playing fair, paying attackers, and fairly exiting the contract.
(3) An attacker could encrypt a file such that it takes an estimated amount of
time on any CPU to decrypt (non-serializable computation, VDFs). An attacker
could commit a time-locked vulnerability report to the Negotiator, putting  
pressure on the contract operator to make a decision within the estimated time.
To our knowledge, such encryption is unfortunately not practically possible at
this point. It is, however, a part of on-going research [11].

#### 7. Committing vulnerabilities will motivate other attackers to audit a contract themselves and drain the contract before it is able to exit.

Malicious attackers can listen to the 0xdeface Negotiator to learn when a
vulnerability has been committed against a contract, and then focus their own
efforts on draining that contract. If the attacker succeeded in draining the
contract illegally before the vulnerable contract exits, it would undermine
legitimate attackers' efforts and defeat the purpose of the protocol. We plan
to investigate Submarine Sends to prevent malicious attackers from scanning the
blockchain and illegally draining committed contracts [15].

In this section, we gave an overview of the protocol's attack vectors. In the
next section, we outline the limitations of the protocol.

### Limitations

We acknowledge that the economic incentives laid out in this document
might not work as intended. In this section, we highlight some of the protocol's
limitations.

#### 1. The attacker does not want to participate in the protocol.

Some attackers will not want to play 0xdeface's game, as there's more money
to be made by simply draining a contract illegally. However, the protocol can
provide an legal alternative to attackers who would prefer to act ethically
and with the approval of the community.

#### 2. What if the attacker simply emails the contract operator.

Assume an attacker finds a vulnerable smart contract that implements the
0xdeface protocol. Instead of using the protocol, they choose to
email the vulnerability report along with a demand for 1 ETH to the
contract operator. While the protocol cannot prevent this behavior, we believe
it would be more beneficial to both parties to work through the protocol's
process:
(1) The protocol makes the disclosure of vulnerabilities transparent by
committing all relevant information on-chain. At any point in the process
anyone can see if the contract is currently under attack, when a
vulnerability was disclosed, and if a contract's exit function was called.
(2) If the contract operator denies an attacker a rightfully earned bounty, the
attacker can use the Proof of Attacking to confirm the legitimacy of the report.
(3) Contract code is often copied and deployed by multiple independent
operators (e.g. Parity's multi-sig wallet). The 0xdeface protocol makes
coordinated shutdowns possible, allowing a smooth shutdown for the contract
operator and a single claim for the attacker.
(4) 0xdeface makes shutdowns of contracts possible in the first place. Most of
the well-known contracts currently do not implement shutdown procedures.
Through 0xdeface's exit function, a contract operator is invited to make a
conscious decision on what to do if their contract is vulnerable even before
deploying it to the network. We argue that this alone will improve overall
security.

#### 3. The exit function will not scale to a large number of users as the block gas number will be reached.

If an attacker reports a vulnerability in a contract implementing the 0xdeface
protocol, and that contract has a large number (e.g. 1000) of "investors" who
have ETH or tokens in the contract that would need to be refunded to the users.
If the contract operator chooses to shut down the contract, the exit procedure
risks hitting the Ethereum block gas limit, meaning the transaction becomes
extremely expensive or fails to execute completely.

In theory, this problem could be mitigated by implementing a procedure inspired
by Plasma exits. The Exploitable contract implements an exit function that
sends all its ETH to a safe contract called "Claimable". The contract operator
scans the original Exploitable contract for all users that have an entitlement.
The contract operator builds a Merkle tree over all the scanned
investor addresses and balances, then submits its root to Claimable. Now, any
user with an entitlement is able to prove their outstanding balance to
Claimable. By calling a function on Claimable that verifies their Merkle proof,
the users can individually reclaim their ETH without having to worry about
hitting the Ethereum block gas limit [14]. We are planning to investigate this
scheme further.

Ultimately, only experimentation and utilization can determine if these or other
limitations restrict the utility of the protocol. We are looking for funding to
pay for this work.

## Funding

The 0xdeface protocol is currently being built by Tim Daubenschütz and Alberto
Granzotto. They are actively looking for grants to fund their work. Here are
some reasons you should fund them:

## Monetization

We're big fans of projects like Uniswap [12]. Uniswap is an Ethereum Foundation
grant recipient. It doesn't require a token and comes with no artificially
added cost for users. That's awesome! However, we're worried that without at a
viable business model, Uniswap will eventually face funding problems.

The default settings for 0xdeface Negotiator will pay a small portion of every
bounty (approx. 5%) to help fund the development and support of the 0xdeface
protocol. The fee will be completely optional and users cannot or do not want to
pay the fee can simply set the fee to 0, but we believe the community will
choose to fund this important security work.

## Conclusion

0xdeface is a fair and secure protocol that creates a positive-sum game by
incentivizing attackers to look for vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts
and disclose those vulnerabilities responsibily rather than draining funds
from those contracts, providing a means for contract operators to shut down
vulnerable contracts, and mitigating harm to the users of those contracts.

## Footnotes

1. We expect there is a hidden community of smart contracts experts on
   Etherscan's "Verified Contracts" page. We hope to legitimize this community
   and give it a home at 0xdeface.me.
2. Ethereum smart contracts will be changeable in-place with the
   Constantinople update in February and the introduction of CREATE2.
3. We are not currently aware of criminal cases against smart contract
   attackers, but it is just a matter of time before such cases are brought.
   Attacks of this nature are plainly illegal, as previous cases about the
   theft of digital goods have shown [7].
4. Even though Gnosis's DAOStack contracts were audited before being deployed
   to the Ethereum main net, these contracts were drained as part of their
   extended bounty program within hours [3].
5. We acknowledge that setting `damage` to an incorrect value could potentially
   lead to an attack vector, where the attacker overstates the criticality of a
   vulnerability's damage. It would be the responsibility of the
   contract operator to do the math on the vulnerability. If they decide to
   decline a legitimate vulnerability because of an overstated `damage`
